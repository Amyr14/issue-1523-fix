# TNT: is not TLA+

Also: *TNT is TLA+ for baby programmers and their babies*

Also: *You can type TNT even of your CAPS LOCK is broken*

This is a surface syntax that uses the same background logic as TLA+
but does not try to mimic general mathematics.

Check the [preliminary syntax](./doc/lang.md). For each construct, we give
an equivalent TLA+ expression and thus define the language semantics by
this simple translation to TLA+.
