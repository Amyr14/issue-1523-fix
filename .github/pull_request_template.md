<!--
There are also some checks in the CI that enforce updates. This is only a
heads up in case your checks unexpectedly fail, but you can also run these
update commands preemptively to avoid any surprises:
- The formatting in all files is consistent with the project's style.
   - Run `npm run format` to automatically format all files.
- The `examples/README.md` file must be updated if any new examples are added or
  if their ability to go through each stage of the pipeline changes.
   - Run `make examples` to automatically update this file locally.
- The assets in `quint/testFixture` and `doc/builtin.md` are consistent.
   - Run `npm run generate` to automatically update these files locally.
